# ARIMA model algorithm

The ARIMA model is characterized by the 3 terms which are;
1. p which is the number of AR terms
2. d which is the number of differencing required for the series to be stationary
3. q which is the number of MA terms

Using Autocorrelation method(ACF) and Passive Autocorrelation method(PACF), the varibales best for the ARIMA model was identified.

The values obtained was;
d = 1, this value was obtained from the ACF plot 
p = 2, which can be taken by the PACF plot by observing the number of significant lags which are above the signficance level.
q = 2, which tells the number of MA terms needed to remove any correlation terms and this value is found using the PACF plot.
